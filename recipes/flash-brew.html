                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        225g Ice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        30g medium-coarse ground coffee (About the size of Diamond Crystal kosher salt)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        225g near-boiling water, roughly (200&#8451;F/93&#8451;C)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Directions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Set a carafe large enough to hold 16 fluid ounces (475ml) of brewed coffee on a digital scale and tare scale to zero. Add 8 ounces (225g) ice. Set a dripper cone on top. Line with paper filter and add the ground coffee. Tare scale to zero once more.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pour just enough near-boiling water onto grounds to wet them, then let stand 30 seconds (this is called blooming the coffee and will improve the flavor of the final brew). Resume pouring near-boiling water all over grounds until the scale reads 8 ounces (225g). Allow water to fully drain through filter, then discard used coffee grounds. Serve iced coffee right away.</p>
